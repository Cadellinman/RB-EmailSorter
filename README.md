# RB-EmailSorter
Script to organise Red Bubble's "You made a sale!" emails en masse, and collate sales figures. It scans your inbox for "you made a sale" messages, collates the sales values into a table and sorts the messages into a folder for you. By default, it converts everything to pounds, but you can change the currency by tweaking the values. Your gmail account will need to be set up for IMAP for this to work.
Made in python 3 with pycharm, use and modify as you will.
